nettail: tail a file on a networked computer

pre-alpha/WIP

I'm using this project to help me learn pthreads and network sockets.

Usage:

nettail-server
	start a server and when the client connects, send lines from the file
	when it's modified

nettail-client <ip> <remote filename>
	connect to <ip>, receive and display lines from <filename>
